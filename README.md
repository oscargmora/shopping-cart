Live Demo ---> https://oscars-shopping-cart.netlify.app/

A very quick and simple fake store! See how react, routing, and API calls work together to create this shopping cart. Using fakestoreapi.com, a catalogue of items is loaded, and allows the user to add and remove from their cart as they were. This also includes react tests, in order to ensure everything is working properly.
